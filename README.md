# Style-Transfer-Keras

Inspired by other implementations of neural networks which can transfer style from one image to another

Mostly an attempt to recreate [this](https://github.com/ShafeenTejani/fast-style-transfer) implementation, but with resize-convolution instead of transpose convolution as suggested by [this](https://distill.pub/2016/deconv-checkerboard/) article.

## Requirements

 * Numpy
 * Scipy
 * Keras
 * Keras_contrib
 * Tensorflow (GPU support highly recommended)

## Deployment

This requires a training set. I used Microsoft's COCO dataset resized to 256x256

## Results

Coming soon
